This repo is intented to house helm charts for the Nautobot project.  (Yes, today that is only the Nautobot chart, but we are ready for more)  Each chart in this repo uses [helm-docs](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs) to generate the README.md for the individual charts.

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```console
helm repo add nautobot https://nautobot.github.io/helm-charts/
```

You can then run `helm search repo nautobot` to see the charts.

To install a chart from the nautobot repo run:

```console
helm install {Release Name} {Repo Name}/{Chart Name}
```

for example:

```console
helm install nautobot nautobot/nautobot
```

## Support

* **Documentation**: Eventually we may have additional documentation on [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/), for now we just have the READMEs.
* **Slack**: checkout the **#nautobot** channel on the [Network to Code slack](https://networktocode.slack.com/)!
